# ZilObjectVisualizer
Object Visualizer for Infocom ZIL Files


When I saw that the source code for ZORK was online I was very excited, but it was a little hard to read, so I wrote this to help visualize the objects and rlationships.  It can parse the main ZIL file and load the objects into memory.  This is another late night hack. I had no idea how the parsing worked so I just did something that worked.  Now that I have a better idea how it works, I might have done it completely differently, but it does load most of the games I tried.

This code is not very good. Ordinarily, I wouldn't post it, but I'm trying to learn github.
